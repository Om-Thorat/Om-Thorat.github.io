how could i just say,  
a happy rose day.  
to a girl with skin   
soft as petals, and bright  
to a girl with hair  
like silk under the moonlight  
to a girl with voice  
like a spring breeze  
to the girl who   
puts my heart at ease  
to the girl who  
is the wind beneath my wings  
to a girl with eyes   
like the morning dew  
who is this girl?  
oh love it's you  
only you and forever you.  
just wish with plain words?  
how could i do?
