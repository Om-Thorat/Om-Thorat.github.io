> Hello Hi Hey Welcome to my first blog post the writing might be weird,boring and rash but bear 🐻 with me as i learn how to write better,  Thanks.

Originally this whole website was supposed to be built in 6 hours, It actually took **3 Days**.

*WHY?* because that's how the whole world works nothing ever goes right you never get your package delivered on time because a ship is stuck in a canal continents away.

Even though I didn't finish on time, I did finish eventually and the experience of building it was nothing but joyous and extremely frustating.

> Content below may include boring technical stuff feel free to not read.

Firstly this Blog and the whole website is built with the amazing framework [Astro🚀](https://Astro.build) the interactive bits are built with the incredible [Svelte](https://Svelte.dev) and styled with [Tailwind](https://Tailwindcss.com).

The experience using all these tools was nothing but Great.

* Smooth lift of with `npm create astro@latest`.  
* Effortless integrations with `npx astro add svelte tailwind mdx`.
* Inbuilt TypeScript Support.

What more could you ask for?

## Astro 🚀

Getting started with Astro might be easier than any other framwork available the integrations were seamless it merely took me 3 commands to get started with Astro,Svelte and tailwind all configured.  
```js
npm create Astro@latest npx 
Astro add tailwind svelte mdx
```
Apart from that the Astro Documentation is very well written 🚀 and setting up a blog has never been easier.

## Svelte 🤖

Svelte stays true to their tagline and truly `cybernetically enhances apps` before using Svelte I tried react and that was just messy I felt like i was somehow writing and doing more than just writing vanilla javascript. Svelte syntax is short , sleek and it will make you question why use any other framework at all.

## Tailwind

Uhh I would like to stay out of this one.  
The only thing i know is that it's much less of a saviour than a mess but then all css is mess.

# See Ya 👋

That's it for now i'll probably update this later i also do have to talk about the butterfly and that one is a story to tell.
