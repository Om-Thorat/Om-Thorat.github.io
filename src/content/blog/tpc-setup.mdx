> > If you don't have the Terminal app you can install it from the Microsoft Windows Store.

2. Check if you have `g++` installed by typing in `g++ --version`. If it returns a version you are all set and can move on to the VS Code setup.

3. If not, no worries. Visit [Scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh). Copy the Given commands show right below QuickStart. Same commands are pasted below for reference.

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
```

Copy the commands given above and paste them in your Terminal.

>> If you experience any errors try updating your Powershell app from the Microsoft store, Or switching to a better internet connection.

Close and reopen your Terminal.

4. On [Scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh) Search for Mingw. Find the one labelled as *mingw in main*. Futher paste the given command in your Terminal.

```bash
scoop install main/Mingw
```

>> If you get an error saying "scoop is not a valid command". Try closing and reopening your Terminal.

5. Close you Terminal and reopen it. Type in `g++` and voila! You have the mingw compiler installed and running.

## MacOS

2. If not, no worries. Check if you have `brew` installed by typing in `brew --version`. If you have brew Installed you can skip to step 6.

3. If not, Head on to [Brew.sh](https://brew.sh) and copy the given command and paste it into your terminal.
