## Windows

1. Make sure you have `Terminal` app installed in your system. You can do so by searching for Terminal in windows start menu.

> > If you don't have the Terminal app you can install it from the Microsoft Windows Store.

2. Visit [Scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh). Copy the Given commands show right below QuickStart. Same commands are pasted below for reference.

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
```

Copy the commands given above and paste them in your Terminal.

>> If you experience any errors try updating your Powershell app from the Microsoft store, Or switching to a better internet connection.

Close and reopen your Terminal.

3. On [Scoop.sh](https://scoop.sh) Search for Mingw. Find the one labelled as *mingw in main*. Futher paste the given command in your Terminal.

```bash
scoop install main/Mingw
```

>> If you get an error saying "scoop is not a valid command". Try closing and reopening your Terminal.

4. Close you Terminal and reopen it. Type in `g++` and voila! You have the mingw compiler installed and running.

## VS Code

1. Download VS Code from [Code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Beware Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio are two different programs. Vs code is a code editor while the latter is a full fledged IDE.

2. Download the Coderunner extension using the VS code extensions tab.

3. Go to extensions > Coderuner > Coderunner Settings. Further look for Run in Terminal and tick the box. Then go ahead and also tick the box for save file before run.

3. Once you have Coderunner downloaded let's create a new file with *Ctrl+n*. Input this basic hello world program in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

4. Save the file with a `.cpp` extension, at your desired place.

5. Now press `Ctrl+Alt+n` to run the code. You should see the output in the terminal below.

6. If you see the output you are all set!.
