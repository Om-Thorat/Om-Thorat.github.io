## Here are some of my designs.  

# 

### * [Personal Website ie this one!](https://www.figma.com/file/82eOJk2QS6VGzSeGV1b8O0/Webfolio-3.0-Original?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=KwIzsh9uGkGmYgIk-0)

> I wanted to do a vibrant color sort of thing that really relfected yk the person i am instead of a very minimalist and simple approach.

### * [A poster for Hackbyte](https://www.figma.com/file/p6AikUljHWD7Ez07GXibNL/Hackbyte-2?type=design&mode=design&t=KwIzsh9uGkGmYgIk-0)

> The idea for this was more of a wake up nothing is real vibe and privacy is a myth. Heavily inspired by the Matrix.

### * [My redesign of this website](https://www.figma.com/file/wY08cf88egfZJgGVtRRsyo/Final-WEBFOLIO-LAST-EXTREME?type=design&mode=design&t=KwIzsh9uGkGmYgIk-0)

> Then maybe i thought this was too much and i need something a bit more minimal not sure if i'll ever implement this one.

### * [Kridoc for SiH'23](https://www.figma.com/file/g9sm7LumWpKlrfHrqCdPDs/Smart-India-Hackathon-23'?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=KwIzsh9uGkGmYgIk-0)

> (incomplete) A very minimal and easy to use design for SiH'23. Sadly the problem statement got removed and we didn't clear and we'll never get to make it.

### * [A frank ocean poster](https://www.figma.com/file/bycmGcVyMFyK3heAGHIsd2/Frank?type=design&mode=design&t=KwIzsh9uGkGmYgIk-0)

> Because i was obsessed and his lyrics kept repeating in my mind anyhow.

*In the end i would like to say I know*
